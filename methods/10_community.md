# Community Building Techniques
#### written with collaborative input from Team "9 Lives" 
Roster: Christopher De Silva, Saranii Muller, Patti Elfers  

### Target Environment: 
School Attributes:
* school size: ~300 
* school grade range: 6-8 
* faculty count: 1 
* courses: 6th grade medialab, 7th grade medialab, 8th grade intensives --> Robotics and Game Design 
  
* * *

### Activity: Open Lab

#### How it Works
Set aside time for students to have open access to the computers and tools in the MediaLab classroom. Could be lunch, recess, or after school. 
  
#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* Give students a community space less chaotic than the gym or recess yard. Just chaotic in a different way.
* Allow students with similar interests to interact across different grades.
* Provide opportunities for students to learn from each other.

#### Rollout Timeline
* Aug - figure out time/days after school bell schedule is finalized.
* Sep - poll likely interested 8th graders (Kian, Shajid, Hannah, Winter, Anniah, Julien) to see what they would be interested in. When etc.
* Sep - start letting students come during specified time. Announce or let it grow organically?
* Oct - review attendance log, who is coming when, patterns, popular days. Change structure depending on attendance.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* number of attendees.
* note activities that students are engaged in.
* focus group questions.

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Encouraging students to be engaged in learning
  * Set aside a game day or time. Or separate gaming time/club.
* phones, if/when and for what
  * Start with no, keep mental note of what they are asking for.
* Too many students.
  * Set a pass system. Maybe different days for different grades or interest groups.
* Burnout
  * Involve other staff
  * Look for student leaders that can help.

### Initiative: Arcade 

#### How It Works
Build a few arcade machines that use a raspi as a controller board. Use them to run scratch games in kiosk mode.

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* Showcase student projects produced at school.
* Excite students about possibility of CS through games.

#### Rollout Timeline
* Sep - Figure out where these can go.
* Oct - get the pi software working. Roll your own for find a source? For [makecode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/raspberry-pi)
* Oct - Gather materials, get parent support.
* Nov - Make it happen, put in games from past years.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Track gameplays? 
* See if there is increased excitement to create games. 
  
#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
- Space, finding a safe enough place for the systems to live.
  - ???? depends on what my room situation will be.
- $$$
  - Fundraise from interested families
- Student access, too much?
  - maybe attach arcades to a positive behavior support, give out game tokens. Setup machine to turn on with coins? [Resource](https://www.adafruit.com/product/787?gclid=Cj0KCQjwio6XBhCMARIsAC0u9aEJXBphpGr6jOdw3JxpLGda9cNL-JhDiuUBhM6sr0V5MJH3HizAfHUaAjo0EALw_wcB)
