GALLERY TOUR LOG

DISCOVERIES:
* Elizabeth chose a nice clean Jekyll file 
* Jenna, good use of tables [here](https://jenna0704.github.io/nycscertweb/)  
* Kerra, putting in nice illustrative code blocks

LINGERING QUESTIONS:
* Why did we separate this from our classwork repo? We could have made use of the docs folder to separate out our work from our display pages. 

COMMENTS/CONCERNS/OTHER:
* Lots of sites, including mine, don't make clear who the author is.
