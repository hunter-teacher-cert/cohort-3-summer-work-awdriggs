## Learning Targets
* I can code conditions using p5 built in variables.

## Starter Code
* [Level 0](https://editor.p5js.org/awdriggs/sketches/8I08ju5bE) - Code a <span style="color:red">Red</span>/<span style="color:green">Green</span> Traffic Light
* [Level 1](https://editor.p5js.org/awdriggs/sketches/beCjy6xOe) - Code a <span style="color:red">Red</span>/<span style="color:Gold">Yellow</span>/<span style="color:green">Green</span> Traffic Light, lots of code stems
* [Level 2](https://editor.p5js.org/awdriggs/sketches/XT2GtqtIQ) - Code a <span style="color:red">Red</span>/<span style="color:Gold">Yellow</span>/<span style="color:green">Green</span> Traffic Light, minimal code stems

## Hints
* `height` is a variable the will always be equal to the height of the canvas
* `mouseX` is a variable that will always equal the current horiziontal position, left and right
* `mouseY` is a varable that will always equal the current vertical position, up and down
